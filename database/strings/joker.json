    "A year ago these cops and lawyers wouldn\u2019t dare cross any of you.",
    "A guy like me . . . I know why you ' re holding your little group therapy session in broad daylight. I know why you\u2019re afraid to go out at night. Batman. He's shown Gotham your true colors. And Dent\u2019s just the beginning.",
    "It\u2019s simple. Kill the Batman. Jeers. Laughter.",
    "Like my mother used to tell me- if you're good at something, never do it for free.",

    "Why so serious?",
    "Now, our organization is small, but we've got a lot of potential for aggressive expansion... so which of you fine gentlemen would like to join our team?",
    "Only one slot open right now- so we're going to have try-outs.",
    "Make it fast.",
    "This is how crazy Batman's made Gotham. You want order in Gotham?",
    "Good evening . We ' re the entertainment .",

    "GORDON",
    "Depending on the time, he might be in one spot.",
    "The good cop, bad cop routine?",
    "Never start with the head... victim gets fuzzy. Can\u2019t feel the next-",

    "I wanted to see what you'd do. And you didn't disappoint...",
    "Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were. But I know the truth- there\u2019s no going back. You've changed things . Forever .",
    "Kill you? I don't want to kill you. What would I do without you?",
    "Don't talk like one of them- you're not, even if you'd like to be. To them you're a freak like me... they just need you right now.",
    "But as soon as they don\u2019t, they'll cast you out like a leper.",
    "Their morals, their code... it\u2019s a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They\u2019re only as good as the world allows them to be. You'll see- I'll show you... when the chips are down, these civilized people... they\u2019ll eat each other.",
    "You have these rules. And you think they'll save you.",
    "Then that's the one you\u2019ll have to break. To know the truth.",

    "Look at you go... does Harvey know about you and his-?",
    "Killing is making a choice...",
    "...you choose one life over the other. Your friend, the district attorney. Or his blushing bride- to-be .",
    "You have nothing. Nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength...",
    "He's at 250 52nd Boulevard. And she's on avenue I at Cicero.",
    "How many of your friends have I killed?",
    "You know why I use a knife, Detective? Guns are too quick.",
    "So, in a way, I knew your friends better than you ever did.",

    "It's not about money. It's about sending a message...",
    "Everything . Burns .",

    "Have to do everything yourself, i always have- and it's not always easy. . . *",
    "smiles",
    "Just couldn\u2019t let me go, could you? I guess this is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?",
    "You won\u2019t kill me out of some misplaced sense of self- righteousness. . . and I won't kill you because you ' re too much fun . We\u2019re going to do this forever.",
    "Maybe we can share it . They \u2019 11 need to double up, the rate this city ' s inhabitants are losing their minds \u2014",
    "Till their spirit breaks completely. Until they find out what I did with the best of them.",
    "You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle for the soul of Gotham in a fist fight with you? You've got to have an ace in the hole.",
